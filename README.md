# Diagnosing Diabetes

## Overview

The **Diagnosing Diabetes** project leverages machine learning to predict diabetes outcomes using logistic regression. The model classifies whether individuals are likely to have diabetes based on their health metrics.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Visualizes correlations between features using heatmaps.
- **Data Preparation**: Splits data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- **Model Training**: Trains a logistic regression model on the training data.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses model accuracy and provides prediction results.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TahaBakhtari/Diagnosing-diabetes.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**:
   ```bash
   cd Diagnosing-diabetes
3. **Install Dependencies:**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib
4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook diagnosing_diabetes.ipynb

## Dataset
The project uses diabetes.csv, containing health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, and age for diabetes prediction.
0 : no diabetes 
1 : diabetes
